# Mandelbrot-Simple
This repository provides a minimalist Mandelbrot set renderer written in C language, designed for simplicity and efficiency. The Mandelbrot set, renowned for its intricate fractal patterns, is rendered onto a simple PNG image. 

The code uses stb_image.h for file writing and pthread.h for multithreading rendering :D
